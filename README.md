**list of potential improvements:**

- TypeScript would fit good here. GraphQL Codegen library would allow us to generate types that we could reuse in frontend application. Migrating to a TypeScript would provide less bugs and useful autosuggestions.
- Migrating to a newer approach - hooks would be a great addition. Using hooks gives us cleaner code. Also class components will most likely get fewer and fewer features since React development team is focusing on hooks.
- Thumbnail in products API to make sure we display the best-looking photo for a product to attract potential customer.
- UX Improvments:
    - Ability to change attributes in cart popover.
    - Clickable logo, redirection to the all categories listing page.
    - Skeleton instead of spinners to improve UX (loading queries).
