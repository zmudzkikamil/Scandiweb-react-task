IMPORTANT! Project was created on Class components instead of Functional components, due to react code exploration. Functional components are better, much cleaner and newer approach.
  
  **Details of web-app:**
  
  - Filtering products by category name for 3 categories: all, clothes and tech.
  - Ability to add/remove products and change their amounts in cart.
  - Ability to change attributes of every product (color, capacity, size etc.).
  - The selected options of added to cart products are visible in cart overlay and in cart page.
  - Ability to change the currency of the store to one of the available currencies.
  - Currency and cart popovers closes by clicking outside of it.
  
  **Technologies:**
  
  - **React.js** which provides good user experience using Virtual DOM etc.
  - **Redux toolkit** to manage the state (to prevent props drilling etc.) 
  - **React Router Dom** to provide a separate URL for every category and product
  - **SCSS** for better styling
  - **GraphQL (Apollo)** to fetch data from endpoint

  **List of potential improvements:**

- TypeScript would fit good here. GraphQL Codegen library would allow us to generate types that we could reuse in frontend application. Migrating to a TypeScript would provide less bugs and useful autosuggestions.
- Migrating to a newer approach - hooks would be a great addition. Using hooks gives us cleaner code. Also class components will most likely get fewer and fewer features since React development team is focusing on hooks.
- Thumbnail in products API to make sure we display the best-looking photo for a product to attract potential customer.
- UX Improvments:
  - Ability to change attributes in cart popover.
  - Clickable logo, redirection to the all categories listing page.
  - Skeleton instead of spinners to improve UX (loading queries).
  - Toast messages after add product to a cart and after increase and decrease quantity.
  - Implement tax in cart popover, not only in cart.
