Improvements:


- Typescript would fit perfectly here. GraphQL Codegen library would allow us to generate API types that we could reuse in frontend application.
- Migrating to a newer approach - hooks would be a great addition. Using hooks gives us cleaner code. Also class components will most likely get fewer and fewer features since React development team is focusing on hooks.
- Thumbnail in products API to make sure we display the best-looking photo for a product to attract potential customer.
- Ability to change attributes in cart (UX improvement)
- Skeleton instead of spinners to improve UX (loading queries)
